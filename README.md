Agreed with Tom and Paul 31/8/18:

We will monitor metrics in the twamp-pe category:

delayP95
packetsLost
througputAvg ( I think is a flowmeter category metric - check with Tom)
jitterP95

We should call:
- an API that gives us managed objects for a specified Service ID
- Raw Metrics for these managed objects, specifying the above metrics
